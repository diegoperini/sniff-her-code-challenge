Code challenge - an example Tinder like dog matchmaking app

This project helped me to find a very satisfying contractual work. It is a good example of readable and maintainable code developed in a limited amount of time. Of course it has it flaws and bugs, but in my case, it was more than enough. It's a mock as you can tell. Hack it with love!
